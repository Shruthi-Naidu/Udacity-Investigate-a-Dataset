# Udacity-Investigate-a-Dataset

### Introduction
For this project, I have chosen TMDb movie dataset for Data Analysis. This dataset contains information about several movies. It contains movie details like movie title, director, genre, budget, revenue, popularity, votes and so on. Let's perform Data Analysis on the TMDb dataset and explore more about data provided in the dataset.

We will now start with the first step in the Data Analysis Process, QUESTION! I want to explore more about budget of the movie and see if spending more money in movie making makes the movie more successful as in yield profit than otherwise. Also, to see if high budget movies are more popular and recieve more public votes. For this dataset, I want to choose movie 'budget' as my dependent variable and explore it with other independent variables.

Here are my questions, 
QUESTION 1 - Do high budget movies have more chances of being successful? 
QUESTION 2 - Are high budget movies more popular?

Using the Python libraries NumPy, Pandas and Matplotlib let's analyze TMDB dataset and then communicate its findings.
